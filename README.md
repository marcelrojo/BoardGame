## Game Description:

"Greed on the Grid" is a competitive board game where 4 players race to collect coins on a grid-based board. Each player starts in a designated corner with a pawn and takes turns rolling a die to determine how many steps they can move in four possible directions: up, down, left or right. Landing on a special tile allows a player to collect a coin, but they cannot use the same special tile twice consecutively. The game ends when a player collects 8 coins, filling their coin slots and is delcared the winner.
