    "\n",
    "\"Greed on the Grid\" is a competitive board game where 4 players race to collect coins on a grid-based board. Each player starts in a designated corner with a pawn and takes turns rolling a die to determine how many steps they can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. Landing on a special tile allows a player to collect a coin, but they cannot use the same special tile twice consecutively. The game ends when a player collects 8 coins, filling their coin slots, and is declared the winner.\n",

    "Our initial approach to coin detection relied on two basic observations: the **coins are circular and have a dark grayish color**. Based on this, we determined that the task was to identify how many dark circles were present in each player's vault.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "To achieve this, we first extracted the warped view of the board and converted it into a blurred grayscale image. Then, we used the **HoughCircles** function with carefully chosen parameters to detect circles on the preprocessed board.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each detected circle, we calculated the mean color within its borders and compared it against a predefined threshold value of (150, 150, 150). Any circle with a **mean color below this threshold** was classified as a coin. Finally, we identified which player owned each coin based on its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images below illustrate the **algorithm's different stages**: the input frame, the extracted board, the detected circles, and the annotated circles filled with their mean color and assigned to the respective players. Examples include one easy frame and one hard frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach performed well for easy images with ideal lighting conditions. Moreover, having an initial overhead view ensured that circles remained undistorted during warping, making their detection nearly flawless. However, problems emerged when tested on more difficult examples. In some cases, warping caused circles to become so distorted that they were no longer recognizable by the HoughCircles algorithm. More importantly, the method was prone to false positives. Relying solely on mean color for thresholding meant that some circles were incorrectly classified as coins when dark shadows were cast on them.\n",

    "The second iteration of our coin detection solution aimed to address the issues identified in the previous approach—specifically, improving the **detection of deformed circles** and avoiding **false detection of shadows** as coins. The first issue was resolved relatively easily by adjusting the parameters of the HoughCircles function to be more tolerant of \"almost circular\" shapes. While this adjustment resulted in detecting more circles than necessary, a simple restriction to circles located within each player's vault effectively eliminated this as a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle the issue of shadows being misclassified as coins, we shifted our perspective: instead of viewing coins as \"dark circles,\" we defined them as \"high-contrast circles relative to the background.\" Our new approach focused on assessing the **contrast between each detected circle and its immediate neighborhood**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the calculations, we utilized a **grayscale** image, as it effectively highlights the lightness or darkness of different areas. For each detected circle, we computed the mean grayscale value within its borders and the mean value for a slightly larger circle centered at the same point. The contrast value was then determined by taking the absolute difference between these two means. To classify a circle as a coin, we compared its contrast value against a threshold determined through manual analysis of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the results, shown in sequence: the input frame, the blurred grayscale image of the warped board, detected circles with their immediate neighborhoods marked and annotated with contrast values, and the final circles classified as coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach performed better on hard examples than the previous one. Shadows were no longer misclassified as coins, and **all circles were correctly detected**, even when deformed. However, the method still made errors, such as misclassifying one circle in an easy example. With a threshold of 35, an empty circle that had a contrast value of 35.07 was incorrectly classified as a coin. On closer inspection, this occurred because the detected circle excluded the \"border\" of the coin's area, which instead appeared in the neighborhood, inflating the contrast value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in other test cases, valid coins had contrast values lower than 35 due to shadows. Simply **increasing the threshold would not solve the problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach provided a strong foundation for our final solution, it required further refinement. Specifically, adjustments were needed for the contrast threshold value, the size of the neighborhood, and techniques to equalize lighting conditions."

For each detected circle, we calculated the **mean RGB color** within its borders and compared it to the expected color characteristics of pawns of different colors.

First, we adjusted the circle detection parameters to allow for detecting **\"almost circles\"** hoping this would capture parts of angled pawns as circles. While this adjustment led to a significant increase in false positives, we mitigated some computational costs by restricting analysis to circles found within the **grid boundaries**.\n",

    "This approach aimed to detect dice in video frames by isolating the board's corners and **analyzing regions outside the board**. It began by identifying the board area using **edge detection** and **contour analysis**, approximating the board's boundary as a quadrilateral. If board corners were not pre-defined, the function determined them dynamically by finding the largest rectangular contour in the frame. A mask was then applied to **exclude the board region** and focus solely on external areas, where dice might appear. Contours in the excluded regions were analyzed based on their size to filter **potential dice candidates**. Once a single contour matched the size criteria, its center was calculated using image moments, and the dice's position was returned.\n",

    "The final version of our pawn detection system takes a drastic departure from previous experiments, as none of them yielded satisfactory results. Our key realization was that the **pawns have significantly different colors** compared to the board, making color the primary feature to focus on rather than shape.\n",

After setting initial HSV boundaries, we used each range to create binary masks that captured only the areas of the image within the thresholds for each color. The results of this step are shown below, with four binary masks for each pawn color highlighting the regions of the board that match the desired ranges.\n",

From these edges, we calculated contours, aiming to **outline each pawn**. To reduce noise, we restricted the area of detected contours, excluding small artifacts or excessively large shadows.\n",

To address this, we introduced a merging step to **connect nearby contours into a single unified shape**. To determine the color of each detected contour, we calculated the overlap between the contour and the masks for each color, assigning the color with the **highest overlap** to the pawn. This approach minimized the risk of false classification caused by small patches of noise in the image.\n",

    "For hard difficulty recordings, the results were slightly less reliable. Camera movement occasionally caused the dice tracking to falsely detect rolling when the dice was stationary. Additionally, dice pip counting often produced incorrect results due to the prominent visibility of the dice's sides when viewed at an angle. Frequent occlusions by the player's hand led to intermittent inconsistencies in tracking the board and game pieces, making these scenarios more challenging for the system.  "

    "Throughout this project, we explored a variety of computer vision techniques to analyze and track elements of a board game. Our approach successfully detected many game elements and displayed gameplay status effectively. By working with a diverse dataset that ranged in difficulty from easy to hard, we developed solutions that performed well in many scenarios. However, the challenges presented by the dataset—such as adapting to diverse recording conditions, including varying lighting, camera angles, and movement—highlighted areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific difficulties included inefficiencies in counting dice pips when the dice were viewed at steep angles. Hand obstructions and camera movement caused temporary inaccuracies in tracking game components, which also impacted overall performance. Similarly, our board detection struggled when obstacles such as an arm obscured the board. To address this, we relied on previously detected board corners and used them consistently throughout the recording, assuming that the board position would not change significantly. These limitations represent opportunities for further refinement and enhancement of our methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, we achieved several significant successes. For example, when recordings captured the board at an angle, we used perspective transformations to ensure that the board and game components remained recognizable. Iterative refinements to algorithms, such as using contrast-based methods for coin detection, minimized false positives caused by shadows or reflections. Furthermore, implementing a re-detection mechanism for dice tracking allowed us to recover from temporary loss of tracking due to obstructions or sudden movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our success was rooted in combining multiple computer vision techniques—edge detection, contour analysis, color space analysis, template matching, and others. This integration of diverse methods was critical in achieving robust performance across various conditions. While there is room for improvement, particularly in handling difficult scenarios, the project demonstrated the potential of combining computer vision methods to analyze complex, dynamic recordings effectively."
